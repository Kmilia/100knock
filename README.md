# Programming 100-Knock Drill

[NLP 100 Exercise 2020 (Rev 2)](https://nlp100.github.io/en/)

This repository contains solutions to the **NLP 100 Exercise 2020**, a bootcamp designed to introduce fundamental concepts in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The solutions I developed were made in 2021 as part of a learning initiative.

## Structure

Each chapter of the bootcamp is organized into its own directory, containing:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** with the solutions.
- Additional generated output files.

Some chapters may have required the use of external datasets. These datasets can be directly downloaded on the [Bootcamp website](https://nlp100.github.io/en/)
