# Programming 100-Knock Drill

[NLP 100 Exercise 2020 (Rev 2)](https://nlp100.github.io/en/)

This repository contains solutions to the **NLP 100 Exercise 2020**, a bootcamp designed to introduce fundamental concepts in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The solutions I developed were made in 2021 as part of a learning initiative.

## Structure

Each chapter of the bootcamp is organized into its own directory, containing:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** with the solutions.
- Additional generated output files.

Some chapters may have required the use of external datasets. These datasets can be directly downloaded on the [Bootcamp website](https://nlp100.github.io/en/)

The chapter 10 has been replace by another assignment: the exploration of different QA prompts for answering factoid questions in English and in Japanese. The goal is to explore the use of an LLM to generate the correct answer of factoid questions. More explanations can be found on *100knock/chapter10/Project.pdf*.
